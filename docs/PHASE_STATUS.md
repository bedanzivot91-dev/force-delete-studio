# Phase Status

Read this before starting any work. Update the row when a phase finishes. Details for each phase are
in `docs/MASTER_SPEC.md` — read only that phase's section, not the whole file, and never the original
giant prompt again.

## Baseline at end of Phase 0

- Build: clean, 0 warnings/errors (8/8 projects).
- Tests: 70/70 passing total — 66 run locally in the dev sandbox, 4 Whisper-model-download integration
  tests verified separately on Windows CI (sandbox proxy blocks huggingface.co).
- Function matrix: 19 `WORKING_VERIFIED`, 33 `IMPLEMENTED_NOT_RUNTIME_VERIFIED`, 0 `BROKEN`,
  0 `PLACEHOLDER`, 9 `NOT_PRESENT`, 0 `BLOCKED_BY_DEPENDENCY` (61 rows total).
- 10/10 of the master prompt's "known problems" claims verified true against real source/CI evidence
  (see `BASELINE_AUDIT.md` §6) — none rejected, none assumed.
- No behavior changed this phase; only `CLAUDE.md` and `docs/*` were added.

## What Phase 1 actually delivered (and what it deliberately didn't)

Delivered:
- Version mismatch fixed for real: `Directory.Build.props` sets `<Version>0.1.0</Version>`; verified
  the compiled assembly now reports `0.1.0.0` (was `1.0.0.0`), and `App.axaml.cs: ThisAssemblyVersion()`
  formats it to exactly `0.1.0`, matching the installer.
- New `IDependencyManagerService`/`DependencyManagerService` (Diagnostics project) + "Alati i modeli"
  screen (`DependencyManagerViewModel`/`View`) showing real Installed/Not-installed status (real
  version-command exit codes, not file-existence guesses) for FFmpeg, FFprobe, yt-dlp, and the Whisper
  model, with a cancellable model download — the app's first Cancel button anywhere.
- `AppSettings.FfmpegPath/FfprobePath/YtDlpPath` wired into the Settings screen (was model-only before,
  BASELINE_AUDIT §8) — with an explicit note that changes need a restart to take effect.
- Portable "ZIP inside ZIP" root cause fixed: CI now uploads the extracted `NPVideoStudio-Portable-x64`
  folder as the workflow artifact instead of an already-zipped file; `build-release.ps1` also produces a
  real `NPVideoStudio-Portable-x64-<version>.zip` (renamed from the old unversioned
  `NPVideoStudio-Portable.zip`) with `VERSION.txt`/`README-FIRST.txt` inside, matching the master
  prompt's requested structure.
- Release cleanup: `build-release.ps1` now strips `.pdb` files and every non-`win-x64` `runtimes/`
  folder (Linux/macOS/win-arm64/win-x86 Whisper native libs) from the publish output before both the
  portable zip and the installer are built from it.
- New tests: `DependencyManagerServiceTests.cs` (6, real ffmpeg/ffprobe + genuinely-absent yt-dlp) and
  one new `[AvaloniaFact]` in `AppSmokeTests.cs` that exercises the real navigation-to-Whisper-status
  chain end to end. Total local (non-integration) tests: 73/73 passing.
- Function matrix updated: 22 `WORKING_VERIFIED`, 38 `IMPLEMENTED_NOT_RUNTIME_VERIFIED`, 0 `BROKEN`,
  0 `PLACEHOLDER`, 7 `NOT_PRESENT`, 0 `BLOCKED_BY_DEPENDENCY` (67 rows).

Deliberately not done (out of scope for what's realistically achievable/verifiable from a Linux sandbox
without downloading large binaries, per the token-saving and dependency-vetting rules):
- No actual `fpcalc`/Chromaprint/Demucs/OCR/AI-worker dependency tracking — none of those tools are
  used by any feature yet (Phases 4/5/7), so `DependencyManagerService` only tracks what's real today.
- No bundled `Tools/ffmpeg/`, `Tools/yt-dlp/` binaries in the repo/portable package — bundling real
  Windows binaries can't be built or verified from this Linux sandbox, and downloading ~100MB+ of
  platform-specific binaries wasn't attempted; the app still resolves these via PATH or a user-set path,
  same as before. This remains a real, open gap.
- Richer dependency states (Ažuriranje dostupno/Oštećeno/Nekompatibilno) — no checksum or
  expected-version pinning system exists to honestly back those, so they weren't faked.
- The CI artifact fix (upload the extracted folder) and the release-cleanup script changes are written
  and reviewed but can only be fully confirmed once this branch's next Windows CI run completes and its
  artifacts are inspected — flagged here rather than claimed as proven before that happens.

## Next action

Start Phase 2 (existing-feature hardening) only when told to proceed.
